# Social Card Previewer

Generate a social card from a site's metadata, simply enter the website's url, the nodejs backend will scrape it for open graph tags, return a JSON response, and the React front end will generate a Social Card from the data.

## What is this 

The social card is generated by scraping the following open graph meta-tags which are in the `head` of the entered url

- title
- description
- url
- image

## Run

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start both react and node simultaneously.
- Enter the name of a site that has open graph tags
